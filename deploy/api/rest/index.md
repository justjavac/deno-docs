# Deno Deploy REST API

Developers can provision projects, domains, KV databases, and other resources
using the Deno Deploy REST API. This API is most often used to implement
[Subhosting](/deploy/manual/subhosting), a use case of Deno Deploy where you can
run untrusted code on behalf of your users in the cloud.

[Refer to the manual](/deploy/manual/subhosting) to learn more about Subhosting.

## Endpoint and authentication

The base URL for the Deno Deploy REST API v1 is below.

```
https://api.deno.com/v1/
```

The v1 API uses
[HTTP bearer token](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/)
authentication. You can create an access token to use the API in the dashboard
[here](https://dash.deno.com/account#access-tokens). Most API requests will also
require your organization ID. You can retrieve yours from the Deno Deploy
dashboard for your organization.

Using both your organization ID and your access token, you can test your API
access by listing all the projects associated with your organization. Here is an
example Deno script you can use to access the API.

```typescript
// Replace these with your own!
const organizationId = "a75a9caa-b8ac-47b3-a423-3f2077c58731";
const token = "ddo_u7mo08lBNHm8GMGLhtrEVfcgBsCuSp36dumX";

const res = await fetch(
  `https://api.deno.com/v1/organizations/${organizationId}/projects`,
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  },
);

const response = await res.json();
console.log(response);
```

## OpenAPI specification and tooling

The [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/) for the Deploy API can be
found here:

```
https://api.deno.com/v1/openapi.json
```

This spec document can be used with a
[large number of OpenAPI-compatible tools](https://openapi.tools/). In addition
to the documentation for the REST API maintained here, you can find
auto-generated API documentation (including a browser-based testing tool)
[here](https://apidocs.deno.com/).
